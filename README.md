## Models and Metrics

Two models were trained using the top 20-30 most important features from Random Forest feature importance:

| Model                   | AUC-ROC | F1-score |
|-------------------------|---------|----------|
| Logistic Regression     | ~0.75   | ~0.63    |
| XGBoost Classifier      | ~0.80   | ~0.68    |

## Key Findings

- **Work interference** is the strongest predictor of treatment-seeking.
- **Family history** plays a major role.
- **Company-provided care options, benefits, and policies** directly impact outcomes.
- **Fear of career consequences** can suppress help-seeking.
- **Small companies** often lack structures to support mental health.

Full recommendations can be found in the report files (`.docx` and `.pptx`).
